This repository showcases a subtle error involving the 'continue' statement in a C while loop.  The code aims to print numbers 1 through 10, omitting 5.  The error arises from the increment operation's position. The solution demonstrates how to correctly structure the code to achieve the intended output. This is a useful example illustrating the importance of precise loop control and the potential for unintended consequences from seemingly minor code changes.
